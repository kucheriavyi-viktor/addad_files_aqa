// let i = 0;
// while(i<=10) {
//   console.log(i);
//   i++;
// }

// The do...while loop
// The last loop you're looking at is the do...while loop, it's a variant of the while loop but 
// with one important difference.
// This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, and 
// then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. 
// For example:

let i=5;
do {  
    console.log(i);
    i++;  
}
while (i<5);

// Create a timer program that will take the number of seconds as input, 
// output the remaining time, and countdown to 0.
// You need to output every number, including 0.

// let num = parseInt(readLine(), 10);
// //your code goes here
// while (num >= 0){
//     console.log(num);
//     num--;
// }
